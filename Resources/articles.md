"Nucleotide and amino acid similarity percentages were determined for the major HCoV-OC43 ORFs and those of other group 2 coronaviruses (BCoV, CRCoV, PHEV, ECoV, MHV, and SDAV). For all HCoV-OC43 ORFs, the highest similarity demonstrated was that to the corresponding BCoV ORFs, except for the HCoV-OC43 E gene, which showed 99.6% identity on the nucleotide level and 98.8% identity on the amino acid level with the PHEV E gene."
